# Packer Setup
1. Go into the install folder - "packer build ubuntu-webserver" or "packer build ubuntu-database"
2. Let packer run, you should now have two box images in the build folder, one for the database and one for webserver
3. "vagrant box add packer_output.box --name boxname"

# To get it setup
1. Make sure you edit the vagrantfiles with the correct box name, or "vagrant init database/webserver" depending on how you name it
2. config.vm.provision :shell, path: "bootstrap.sh"
3. config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.X" -- make sure you set it up with your assigned IP address, otherwise you can refer to http://askubuntu.com/questions/470237/assigning-a-static-ip-to-ubuntu-server-14-04-lts
4. Look at the credentials of the provisioner file, those are defaults, change them as you like
5. You can either spinup the database's phpmyadmin or directly go into mysql and import database schema from file "hawkstagram.sql"
