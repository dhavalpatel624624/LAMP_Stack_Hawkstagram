# Packer Setup
1. Go into the install folder
2. "packer build ubuntu14045-webserver"
3. "packer build ubuntu14045-database"
4. "packer build ubuntu14045-slave" 
5. Let packer run, you should now have three box images in the build folder, one for the database, webserver and slave
6. "vagrant box add packer_output.box --name webserver"
7. "vagrant box add packer_output.box --name database"
8. "vagrant box add packer_output.box --name slave"
9. (OPTIONAL) "vagrant box list" to confirm that you correctly added the two boxes

# Webserver Installation
1. Make sure you edit the vagrantfiles with the correct box name, or "vagrant init webserver"
2. config.vm.provision :shell, path: "../scripts/webserver.sh" -- change pathfile to scripts folder depending on where box is initialized
3. config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.X" -- make sure you set it up with your assigned IP address, otherwise you can refer to http://askubuntu.com/questions/470237/assigning-a-static-ip-to-ubuntu-server-14-04-lts
4. Look at the credentials of the provisioner file, those are defaults, change them as you like
5. Edit the appropriate shell script for the GITUSER and GITPASS fields at the top so the provisioner can automate git cloning.
6. "vagrant up" or "vagrant reload --provision"
7. "vagrant ssh" -- make sure you let each box vagrant up itself first, otherwise you may run into errors. if you do, let one box finish spinning up and then spin up the second.

# Database Installation
1. Make sure you edit the vagrantfiles with the correct box name, or "vagrant init database"
2. config.vm.provision :shell, path: "../scripts/database.sh" -- change pathfile to scripts folder depending on where box is initialized
3. config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.1.X" -- make sure you set it up with your assigned IP address, otherwise you can refer to http://askubuntu.com/questions/470237/assigning-a-static-ip-to-ubuntu-server-14-04-lts
4. Look at the credentials of the provisioner file, those are defaults, change them as you like
5. Edit the appropriate shell script for the GITUSER and GITPASS fields at the top so the provisioner can automate git cloning.
6. "vagrant up" or "vagrant reload --provision"
7. "vagrant ssh" -- make sure you let each box vagrant up itself first, otherwise you may run into errors. if you do, let one box finish spinning up and then spin up the second.

# Slave Installation
1. Build packer
2. Add the box, call it slave 
3. Make new folder somewhere called Slave
4. Powershell into that folder
5. Vagrant init slave
6. Edit Vagrantfile with the designated slave IP, database.sh script, and the following line "config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 4567"
7. SSH into your master DB box 

sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

*These will primarily be comments, so just uncomment them*
bind-address = same IP for main database vagrant box
server-id = 1
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
bindlog_do_db = hawkstagram

Save file

Login to main database:
mysql -u root -p

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'dbuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'hawkstagram123';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
SHOW MASTER STATUS;

example:
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File             | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysql-bin.000001 |      107 | newdatabase  |                  |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

*If you do not see this example, first try to restart the mysql service, as well as confirm that the IP address in the my.cnf file is correct

Take note of the "000001" and the position, they may be different from this example. 

UNLOCK TABLES;

QUIT;

8. Go back to the slave DB box, since you should already have a Hawkstagram db already from the initializing shell script do the following things. 

sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

bind-address = IP address for slave DB vagrant box
server-id = 2
log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
bindlog_do_db = hawkstagram

Save

9. sudo service mysql restart
10. Go back into your slave DB box and do the following in a mysql prompt,

sLogin to main database:
mysql -u root -p

CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='Your MASTER IP',
MASTER_USER='dbuser', 
MASTER_PASSWORD='hawkstagram123', 
MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',(Your bin from earlier) 
MASTER_LOG_POS=  107; (Your pos number from earlier)

STOP SLAVE;

RESET SLAVE;

11. Now make an edit on the master database such as inserting a new user

INSERT INTO users (username, email, salted_password, first_name, last_name, date_created, date_updated)
VALUES ('Toad', 'toad@hawk.iit.edu', 'password', 'Toad', 'Toad', NOW(), NOW());

12. Now on the SLAVE database:

SELECT * FROM users; 

It should show the newly added user. If not, in mysql use the command: use hawkstagram;

13. This command will show the status of the slave:
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G 

The top should say "Waiting for master to send event." and

Slave_IO_Running: YES 
Slave_SQL_Running: YES

*If you are having issues with the slave database, please run these commands:

SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 5;
SLAVE START;


Make a new line with:
relay-log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log

# Integrating Webserver to Slave and Master DB

1. SSH into your three boxes
2. In WEBSERVER, cd /var/www/html/webpages/includes
3. sudo vim dbconnect.php and change the IPs to your salve and master db
4. In MASTER DB, login to mysql: 
mysql -u root -p 
GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON hawkstagram.* TO ''@'your webserver IP' identified by 'hawkstagram123';

5. In SLAVE DB, login to mysql:
mysql -u root -p 
GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON hawkstagram.* TO ''@'your webserver IP' identified by 'hawkstagram123';

6. In your WEBSERVER, test if your database is connected:
cd /var/www/html/webpages/includes

php dbconnect.php

You should get: 
Connected successfully to master db!
connected successfully to slave db!

# Encrypt Databases (Uses MariaDB due to issues with MySQL 5.5 encryption)
 
 First you should copy your original database box and make a new vagrant box in a different folder to do this just in case anything screws up.

vagrant package --output database2

Go into new folder:

vagrant init database2

vagrant up

Remove mysql:
sudo apt-get remove mysql-server

sudo apt-get remove mysql-client

Update MariaDB repos for our ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xcbcb082a1bb943db

sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386,ppc64el] http://mirrors.accretive-networks.net/mariadb/repo/10.2/ubuntu trusty main'

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

Restart database:

sudo service mysql restart (MariaDB uses same commands as MySQL)

Run a mysql upgrade: (I think this helps with installing the plugins necessary for encryptions)

mysql_upgrade -u root -p

Edit conf file under the [mysqld] section

sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

skip-eternal-locking

plugin-load-add=file_key_management.so

file-key-management

file-key-management-filename=/home/vagrant/keys.enc

innodb-encrypt-tables=ON

innodb-encrypt-log

innodb-encryption-threads=4

Save file

Now make a file called keys.enc and just put this at the top

1;275F957BBA71D20F42826C3854C7B869;C1845BA78881CE2DE5D1165F359F885A4E7F042850376FBC14CF0B900B

This is a key made with openssl using the password hawkstagram123. If we want more keys we just make them with openssl put them into the file.

Save file

Restart the database

sudo service mysql restart

sudo mysql -u root -p

Now we can go ahead and encrypt our tables4

use hawkstagram;

ALTER TABLE users ENCRYPTED=YES ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID=1;
